Trying out some reinforced learning for tic tac toe, from scratch!

0. Make a game history recording class (used for referencing in makeMove)
0. Make a game history individual class (who won, board state, and previous games)
0. Make a game result class (who was first, type of win. others?)
0. Make make move actually use the history
